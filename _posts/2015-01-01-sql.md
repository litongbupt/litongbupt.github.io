在几千条记录里,存在着些相同的记录,如何能用SQL语句,删除掉重复的呢?    
1、查找表中多余的重复记录，重复记录是根据单个字段（peopleId）来判断

    select * from people
    where peopleId in (select  peopleId  from  people  group  by  peopleId  having  count(peopleId) > 1)
    
2、删除表中多余的重复记录，重复记录是根据单个字段（peopleId）来判断，只留有rowid最小的记录

    delete from people 
    where peopleId  in (select  peopleId  from people  group  by  peopleId   having          count(peopleId) > 1)
    and rowid not in (select min(rowid) from  people  group by peopleId  having count(peopleId )>1)

3、查找表中多余的重复记录（多个字段） 

    select * from vitae a
    where (a.peopleId,a.seq) in  (select peopleId,seq from vitae group by peopleId,seq  having count(*) > 1)

4、删除表中多余的重复记录（多个字段），只留有rowid最小的记录

    delete from vitae a
    where (a.peopleId,a.seq) in  (select peopleId,seq from vitae group by peopleId,seq having count(*) > 1) and rowid not in (select min(rowid) from vitae group by peopleId,seq having count(*)>1)

5、查找表中多余的重复记录（多个字段），不包含rowid最小的记录

    select * from vitae a
    where (a.peopleId,a.seq) in  (select peopleId,seq from vitae group by peopleId,seq having count(*) > 1) and rowid not in (select min(rowid) from vitae group by peopleId,seq having count(*)>1)
